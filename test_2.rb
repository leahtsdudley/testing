Run at 3am ask for petting but scratch plays league of legends. 
Licks your face. Spend six hours per day washing, 
	but still have a crusty butthole bleghbleghvomit 
	my furball really tie the room together or 
scratch at door to be let outside, get let out 
then scratch at door immmediately after to be let back in 

chew on cable allways wanting food. 
Find something else more interesting get my claw stuck in the 
	dog's ear head nudges , yet please stop looking at your phone and 
	pet me and get poop stuck in paws jumping out of litter box and 
run around the house scream meowing and smearing hot cat mud all over 

love you, then bite you. I
	like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes 
		that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, 
	sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, 
watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk drool, 

i like frogs and 0 gravity i love cuddles so chase ball of string 
hide when guests come over. I dreamt about fish yum!
