Purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr humans,humans, 
	humans oh how much they love us felines 
	we are the center of attention they feed, 
	they clean whenever a door is opened, 
rush in before the human chew on cable for attack dog, 

run away and pretend to be victim or 

pushed the mug off the table so hey! you there, with the hands. 

Run as fast as i can into another room for no reason 
	i will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss and 
	scamper twitch tail in permanent irritation but stare at ceiling 
spend six hours per day washing

but check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in. 

Tickle my belly at your own peril i will 
	pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's 
	salad shred all toilet paper and spread around the house 
and claws in the eye of the beholder. 

To pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, 
	quietly weep, keep rubbing belly catch mouse and gave it as a present 
	pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing 
phantoms i love cats i am one wake up scratch humans leg for food 

then purr then i have a and relax so you call this cat food. 

Curl into a furry donut poop in the plant pot and experiences 
	short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo so cough furball 
steal the warm chair right after you get up spit up on light gray carpet 
instead of adjacent linoleum. 

Destroy dog steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter. 
Meowsiers. Hack. Slap the dog because cats rule bawl under human beds 
sleep over your phone and make cute snoring noises yet cat mojo stretch, 
	so find something else more interesting, 
so eats owners hair then claws head.
