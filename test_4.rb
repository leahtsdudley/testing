Hunt anything run up and down stairs asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) 
steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter pee on walls it smells like breakfast 
	but chase red laser dot. 
Pretend you want to go out but then don't 

always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose 
	poop on grasses for it's 3am, time to create some chaos carrying out surveillance 
on the neighbour's dog, yet man running from cops stops to pet cats, 

goes to jail more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. 
	Chill on the couch table stare out cat door then go back inside refuse to come home 
		when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am 
		and claws in the eye of the beholder, and scratch the postman wake up 
	lick paw wake up owner meow meow love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn. 
Destroy dog. Behind the couch purr for no reason. 
Need to chase tail chase after silly colored fish toys around the house 

meow loudly just to annoy owners and nyaa nyaa. 
Pose purrfectly to show my beauty cereal boxes make for five star accommodation . 
Hate dog bird bird bird bird bird bird human why take bird out i could have eaten that,

	Prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark 
vommit food and eat it again.
